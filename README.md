# ATMOS
ATMOS — Another time management open source application

## WHAT
ATMOS is a pet-project that I create to improve and proof my programming skills.

## WHY
Like any other programmer, I do my own project if existing projects don’t do what I need (even if they do)

## WHEN
Now I’m developing a database schema and thinking about a list of MVP functions, so not soon.
